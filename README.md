# Johan Fridlund
👋Hi im Johan, a Computer Engineering student at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. With a passion for computers, programming and new technology I am longing to get out into the programming world and learn a bunch more!

## My values
💖 Safety and trust<br>
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared norms<br>
🚀 Elevate the underrepresented

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
